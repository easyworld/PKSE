/**
 * Types come from PersonalInfoTable, the same place as the abilities and gender ratio, per
 * (species, form), because that is the only place they can be kept correct: PersonalInfoTable is
 * regenerated from PKHeX, and its form redirection is the same one every other per-form fact
 * already goes through.
 *
 * Hand-written rows scraped from a web dex cannot be right here, because they carry no form
 * dimension: every retyping form then has to be re-stated by hand, and the ones missed -- Hisuian
 * Braviary among them -- quietly return the base species' types. 149 of the 465 alternate forms
 * retype their base species.
