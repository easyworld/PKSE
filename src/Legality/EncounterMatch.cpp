/**
 * The match runs in stages, and the stage a candidate fails at gets reported.
 * Anything that matched further is a better explanation of the Pokemon than anything
 * that failed earlier, so the report only ever describes the FURTHEST stage reached:
 *
 *      none ->     species has no encounter at all in this game
 *      form ->     the species does, but never in this form
 *      location -> right form, but never at this met location
 *      level ->    right place, but not at this met level
 *      full ->     a template matched; only its fixed data can still disagree
 *
 * That ordering is the whole reason a Pokemon does not get three overlapping
 * complaints about one problem.
