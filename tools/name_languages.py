"""The language order the generated name tables use. MIRRORS include/Names/NameLanguage.h.

Every gen_*names.py emits its tables as an array of LANGUAGE_COUNT pointers in this order, and
Names::displayLanguageIndex() is what indexes them at runtime. The order deliberately is NOT
Enums::LanguageID's numbering -- that starts at 1, reserves 0 for "unset" and leaves an unused hole
at 6, none of which an array wants.

Keeping the order in one module rather than repeating the list in each generator is the same rule
the C++ side follows: one concept, one definition. A generator that hardcoded its own order would
produce a table that indexes correctly for the language it was tested in and silently returns
Korean for Spanish everywhere else.
