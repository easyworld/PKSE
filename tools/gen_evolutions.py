"""Generate include/Pokemon/EvolutionTable.h + src/Pokemon/EvolutionTable.cpp -- the
per-game REVERSE evolution lineage (what a species+form evolved FROM), plus the per-game
FORWARD table of trade evolutions (what a species+form becomes when it is traded).

Layer 3 legality needs this at runtime. An encounter template records the species that
was actually caught, so a Charizard met on Route 3 has to be matched against the
*Charmander* slot there; without the lineage every evolved Pokemon reads as "no
encounter produces this species". gen_learnsets.py already walks the same lineage, but
it folds the result into its move bitsets at generation time and never emits the edges,
so there is nothing to reuse at runtime.

Source: PKHeX's evos_<game>.pkl, read exactly as gen_learnsets.read_evolutions does
(EvolutionReversePersonal.GetLineage -- walk every source species+form, register the
reverse edge for each destination it leads to, first source wins). This script imports
those helpers rather than restating them, so the two tables can never disagree about
what an ancestor is.

The lineage is PER GAME because the games disagree: Pichu is absent from Let's Go, so a
Pikachu there did not evolve from one, and a regional form's chain differs from its
Kantonian counterpart's. Edges whose source is not present in that game are dropped for
the same reason gen_learnsets skips them.

Regenerate:  python tools/gen_evolutions.py
