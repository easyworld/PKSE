"""Generate the fixed save-block tables -- ONE FILE PER SAVE-FORMAT GROUP.

WHICH GROUPS GET ONE, AND WHY ONLY THESE SIX. A block table describes a save that is a fixed list
of blocks, each with its own offset, length and checksum. Six groups are shaped that way:
Black/White and Black 2/White 2 on DS, and X/Y, Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, Sun/Moon and Ultra
Sun/Ultra Moon on 3DS -- 333 blocks between them, which is 333 chances to mistype a hex number,
and a wrong (offset, length) still produces a perfectly valid CRC over the wrong range. Nothing
downstream can catch that, which is why these are generated rather than typed.

Nothing else needs one. Gens 1 and 2 are flat SRAM whose offsets shift with the locale, Gen 3 is
fourteen rotated sectors each carrying its own id, Gen 4 is two partitions holding a General and a
Storage block, and BDSP is a flat fixed-offset image -- all a handful of constants or arithmetic.
Let's Go, Sword/Shield, Legends: Arceus, Scarlet/Violet and Legends: Z-A use SCBlocks, where the
block list is data inside the save and a static table is impossible rather than merely redundant.

ONE FILE PER GROUP, not one per generation. The tables used to live in Gen5Blocks.h and
Gen67Blocks.h, the second of which covered four games across two generations. The DATA was already
split per group there, so this is a move rather than a repair -- but a header that serves four
games is the shape that lets a fifth quietly share a table it should not.

THE GEN 5 NAMED INDICES ARE NOW DERIVED PER GAME. They used to be five hardcoded constants shared
by Black/White and Black 2/White 2, correct because the two block orders agree up to #27 -- a claim
that lived in a comment with nothing checking it, while the only static_asserts pinned the block
COUNTS (70 and 74). A reorder of either game's first 28 blocks would have left the counts matching
and silently pointed Black/White's inventory at Black 2's block. Each game's indices are now looked
up in ITS OWN table by block name, and a name that is missing or ambiguous fails the run.
