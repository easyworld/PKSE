/**
 * formspritemap.cpp - (species, form) -> the PokeAPI id PKSE already maps for sprites.
 *
 * Built and run by tools/gen_formnames.py, which needs a way to ask PokeAPI about a specific form.
 * PKSE already carries a VERIFIED (species, form) -> PokeAPI id table in FormSpriteMapping (every
 * row was checked against the API's own `name` when the sprite was added), so the generator uses
 * that rather than guessing a slug from the species name -- a wrong-but-existing id fetches a
 * completely different Pokemon's form label with no error, the same trap the sprite table warns
 * about.
 *
 * PEER FAMILIES CARRY THEIR IDENTITY IN THE STEM, NOT THE ID. Flabebe, Burmy, Alcremie and Unown
 * are keyed by NAME upstream, so getFormSpriteId returns the bare species and only
 * getFormSpriteName distinguishes the form (`669-yellow`). Emitting both lets the generator ask
 * for `flabebe-yellow` rather than the default form, which is what it would otherwise get.
 *
 * Note the two id spaces are NOT the same: these are `/api/v2/pokemon/` ids, so the generator
 * resolves `/pokemon/<id>/` -> name -> `/pokemon-form/<name>/`. Asking `/pokemon-form/<id>/`
 * directly returns an unrelated form (10033 is venusaur-mega in one space and deoxys-speed in the
 * other).
