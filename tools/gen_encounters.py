"""Generate include/Legality/EncounterTable.h + src/Legality/EncounterTable.cpp -- the
per-game encounter templates Layer 3 legality matches a Pokemon against.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
PKHeX models an encounter as a rich template plus an RNG correlation: it can prove a
specific seed produced a specific PID/IV spread. PKSE does not attempt that. What it
keeps is the part that answers the questions a save editor can actually be wrong about:

    * is there any encounter in this game that produces this species+form,
    * at the met location the Pokemon claims,
    * at the met level it claims,
    * and does that encounter's fixed data (shiny lock, ball, gender, nature,
      guaranteed-31 count, alpha, fateful) agree with what the Pokemon holds?

So every template collapses to one flat row. Wild slots additionally MERGE: all the
slots for one (species, form, location) in one game fold into a single row whose level
span is their union. That is deliberately permissive -- a merged span can admit a level
that no individual slot offered -- and permissive is the right direction for a checker
that reports problems rather than granting approval.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT MODELLED
---------------------------------
* Ability slot. Ability Capsule (1<->2) and Ability Patch (->hidden) exist from Gen 8
  on, so a template's AbilityPermission says nothing about what the Pokemon holds now.
  Storing the column would only invite a check that false-flags legitimate saves.
  Layer 2 already verifies the ability is one the species can have at all.
* Mystery Gift / event distributions. That is its own database (PKHeX's mgdb) and its
  own workstream; see docs/FUTURE_VERSIONS.md. The matcher compensates by softening its
  verdict for a Pokemon flagged as a fateful encounter.
* Seed / PID correlations, marks, ribbons, relearn moves, HOME trackers.

SOURCES (all PKHeX, pinned by tools/pkhex_source.py)

Wild slots come from the binary .pkl area blobs, each with its own layout:

# Mystery Gift distributions (the EVENT half of Layer 3)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every officially distributed Pokemon is a Mystery Gift card, and PKHeX ships the
# whole database as flat arrays of fixed-size records -- one .pkl per format, length
# an exact multiple of the record size. That is all the structure there is, so these
# need no container decoding: seek to the offsets and read.
#
# They become ORDINARY EncounterRows with kind "event". The alternative -- a second
# table with its own matcher -- would have duplicated the species index, the
# pre-evolution walk and every constraint check, and the two would have drifted. A
# distribution IS an encounter template; it differs only in where it came from.
#
# Offsets are transcribed from the PKHeX classes named per format below. They are
# read straight out of the record and are the single thing that would silently
# produce a table of plausible-looking nonsense if they were wrong -- which is why
# the parser VALIDATES every record it keeps (species in range, level 1-100) and
# fails loudly on a file whose length is not a whole number of records.
#
# Gen 3 (FireRed/LeafGreen) is deliberately absent: PKHeX has no mgdb pickle for it.
# Its distributions live in hand-written arrays of a different shape, so a Gen 3
# fateful Pokemon still takes the softened "event Pokemon are not checked" path.
