"""Fetch the origin markings into romfs/sprites/marks/.

THESE ARE THE GAMES' OWN ORIGIN MARKS, which is why they are fetched rather than drawn: the Kalos
pentagon, the Alola clover, the Galar mark and the rest are what the games themselves stamp on a
Pokemon's summary, and PKHeX already carries clean 40x40 alpha masks of them. Bank, HOME and PKSM
all mark a Pokemon's origin this way.

GEN 3, 4 AND 5 HAVE NO MARK AND MUST NOT BE GIVEN ONE. Nothing existed before the Kalos pentagon,
so PKHeX has no resource for them and inventing one would be PKSE asserting a mark that does not
exist. Those origins are named in TEXT instead -- which they can be, because unlike a PK1/PK2 they
carry a version byte.

They are black silhouettes with an alpha channel; SpriteManager tints them to the theme, the same
thing PKHeX does with BlackToWhite in dark mode.

MARK_NAMES is the file half of `Trainer::OriginMark`. A mark added to that enum without a row here
is a missing file at runtime, and nothing on screen says which.

Not routed through pkhex_source.py: that module serves PKHeX.Core, and these live in the WinForms
resources, so PKHEX_LOCAL would not find them.

Needs nothing but Python 3.

Run:  python tools/gen_marks.py            # fetch whatever is missing
      python tools/gen_marks.py --force    # re-fetch all of them
