"""Generate PKSE's Generation 1 (Red/Blue/Yellow) data tables from PKHeX.

Gen 1 gets its OWN tables. Not out of tidiness -- every table below differs from the modern
one in a way that is silent rather than loud, which is the failure mode this codebase keeps
paying for. Four concrete reasons, each with a precedent in docs/BUGS.md:

1. BASE STATS. Gen 1 has a single **Special** stat, not SpA/SpD. Gyarados is SPC 100 in Gen 1;
   the modern row says SpA 60 / SpD 100. Reading the modern row computes a wrong special stat
   for essentially every Pokemon in the game, and PKSE writes the computed battle stats back
   into the record -- so the wrongness persists. (Same shape as the Gen 3 base-stat split that
   gen_personal.py already carves out: Dugtrio's Attack went 80 -> 100 after Gen 3.)

2. SPECIES INDEX. Gen 1 stores an internal index, not a National Dex number, and the ordering
   is arbitrary -- Ivysaur is 0x09, Bulbasaur is 0x99. This is exactly BUGS Issue 36, where
   Gen 3's index was assumed to be a flat +25 shift and 109 of 135 Hoenn species were stored as
   a different Pokemon. There is no formula here at all; it is a lookup or it is wrong.

3. TYPE IDS. Gen 1's ROM numbering is not the modern one and is not even contiguous: Normal 0,
   Fighting 1, Flying 2, Poison 3, Ground 4, Rock 5, **Bug 7, Ghost 8** (6 is the unused "Bird"
   slot), then **Fire 20, Water 21, Grass 22, Electric 23, Psychic 24, Ice 25, Dragon 26**.
   PKSE's TYPE_* constants are the contiguous MoveType numbering (Bug 6, Ghost 7, Fire 9...).
   Handing a raw Gen 1 type byte to the type-icon lookup draws a Bug as Ghost, a Ghost as Steel,
   and every special type as an out-of-range id. We map to PKSE ids HERE, once, at generation
   time, so no call site can forget. (BUGS Issue 26 is the same bug with forms.)

4. MOVE PP. MoveInfo1.PP is Gen 1's own table. PP is stored per-move in the record and is what
   the game shows; a modern PP value is simply a different number.

Deliberately NOT generated here, because Gen 1 does not have them and inventing a zero would be
worse than having nothing: abilities, natures, gender, egg groups, friendship, held items, balls,
met location, origin game, shininess, Pokerus. A Gen 1 Bulbasaur has no ability; the details view
must say so rather than print "Overgrow".

Reused rather than duplicated, because they are genuinely identical: species names #1-151 and
move names #1-165 (same strings), and the six growth-rate EXP curves in Experience.cpp. The
growth-rate *index per species* is still emitted below -- it is one byte and it removes the
question -- and this script cross-checks it against Gen 3 and reports any species that disagree.
