/**
 * LCG-XOR keyed on the EncryptionConstant at 0x00, four blocks shuffled by (EC >> 13) & 31, and
 * the party tail crypted with the same seed. Structurally the Gen 8 path with a smaller block --
 * 56 (0x38) rather than 80.
 *
 * The checksum is NOT the key here, unlike Gen 4/5, so the familiar order applies:
 * recalculateStats() -> refreshChecksum() -> encrypt.
 *
 * The shuffle value is (PID >> 13) & 31 and there are four blocks of 0x38.
