/**
 * When a banked Pokemon is withdrawn into a save of a DIFFERENT game, its native bytes must be
 * re-formatted into the destination game's entity format. Following PKHeX/HOME: the origin identity
 * (Version, OT, ID, met/egg, HOME tracker, EC/PID/IVs/nature/gender/language/ribbons) is preserved
 * verbatim; only game-specific container fields are rewritten, and the checksum is refreshed.
 *
 * PKSE preserves origin identity + ability but SANITIZES the moveset for the destination: any move (or
 * relearn move) the destination species can't legally learn -- illegal for the species, OR not present in
 * that game at all -- is cleared to empty (see convert()). This is REQUIRED: Let's Go turns a pokemon carrying
 * an impossible move into a Bad Egg. The held item is sanitized the same way, against a per-game holdable-
 * item table: it is cleared if the destination cannot hold that id, which includes EVERY id for Let's Go and
 * Legends: Arceus (neither game has a held-item mechanic at all).
 * (PKHeX instead regenerates the whole moveset from the destination learnset via HOME; we keep the pokemon's
 * own legal moves and only drop the illegal ones.) Same-generation sibling pairs (SwSh<->BDSP, S/V<->Z-A) share
 * a near-identical layout (copy + null a couple of divergent fields). Cross-generation pairs (PK8<->PK9) are a
 * field remap: gender bit-position, Version/Language/FormArg/AffixedRibbon offsets, height/weight/scale,
 * HOME-tracker offset, and the record-flag / Tera / ObedienceLevel regions are re-laid-out; the Tera type
 * is imported from the species' primary type (PK8 has none). Legends: Arceus (PA8) has its whole Block
 * B/C/D at different offsets, so it is a full field relocation routed through the PK8 layout (PA8<->PK8,
 * then the PK8<->PK9 transforms for a Gen 9 endpoint); PA8-only data (GVs, Alpha, move-mastery) is dropped
 * and LA-only balls collapse to a Poke Ball. Let's Go (PB7, 260-byte Gen-7 record) likewise relocates
 * through the PK8 layout, but stat-training is NOT cross-converted: AVs/EVs are dropped so a pokemon entering
 * LGPE gets AVs=0 and one leaving gets EVs=0 (the UI asks the user to acknowledge this); its Level/stats/CP
 * tail is recomputed on convert. FireRed/LeafGreen (PK3, 80/100-byte GBA record) is the most divergent:
 * no EC (EC:=PID), nature/gender/shiny are all PID-derived, ability is a slot BIT resolved via the personal
 * table, species/items/text use Gen-3 id spaces, and IVs pack the ability bit at 31. Its remap converts
 * item ids (Item3to4), transcodes Gen-3<->Unicode names, and sanitizes the moveset against the real Gen-3
 * learnset like every other game; Level/stats are recomputed on convert. Going TO Gen 3, nature/gender become
 * PID-derived (Gen 3 stores neither) and the LANGUAGE is clamped to one Gen 3 shipped a game in -- which
 * decides the character table both names are written through, so a Korean or Chinese Pokemon becomes an
 * English one and its nickname falls back to the English species name. A nickname is otherwise carried,
 * and an un-nicknamed Pokemon arrives holding its own language's species name (Gen 3 has no is-nicknamed
 * flag, so that string is the only way to say "not nicknamed"). The OT name is the one field with no
 * fallback: it is carried when the destination's alphabet can spell it and left BLANK when it cannot --
 * see canStoreOriginalTrainerName, which is what the confirm dialog warns from. Sun/Moon and Ultra
 * Sun/Ultra Moon (PK7, the 232/260-byte 3DS record) are siblings of each other and reach the hub by a
 * remap that is the PB7 one plus everything Let's Go dropped -- held item, EVs, contest stats, both
 * trainers' memories -- while the Gen-7-only regions (Super Training, Poke Pelago, the 3DS geolocation
 * block, affection) have nowhere to go in Gen 8 and are dropped. Every conversion is thus a PK8-layout
 * hub: any game <-> any other (full two-way, beyond HOME's one-way Let's Go limit), bounded only by
 * destination dex-presence.
 *
 * GEN 1 AND GEN 2 JOIN THE HUB ONE WAY, THROUGH POKE TRANSPORTER. A PK1/PK2 is not remapped onto a
 * modern layout; it is run through the transfer the Virtual Console games actually had -- which builds
 * a PK7 -- and the result then travels the ordinary hub. That step INVENTS most of a modern record,
 * because a PK1 has no nature, ability, PID, ball, met data or origin game to carry: see the block
 * comment above transportVirtualConsoleToPK7() in Convert.cpp for the full recipe and for the three
 * things PKSE cannot reproduce (the origin title is a guess; names are written in English; the 3DS
 * locale block stays blank). Nothing converts BACK: a PK1 has no room for what it would be handed.
