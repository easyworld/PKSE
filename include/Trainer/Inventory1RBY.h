     * Red/Blue/Yellow bag pouches. Gen 1 has exactly two containers and ONE legal item set behind
     * both: PKHeX's ItemStorage1 exposes a single `General` span and returns it for every
     * InventoryType, because the item PC in Gen 1 accepts everything the bag does.
     *
     * Unlike every later generation, the OFFSETS are not constants here. A Gen 1 save's layout
     * depends on its locale -- a Japanese save's name fields are 6 bytes instead of 11 and every
     * offset from the trainer block onward shifts -- so the addresses live in Trainer1RBY's
     * RBYOffsets and only the pouch identity, display name and slot count are fixed.
     *
     * Each slot on disk is 2 bytes: u8 item id + u8 count, preceded by a one-byte count and
     * terminated by 0xFF. That framing is Trainer1RBY's business; this header exists so the pouch
     * names and capacities have one home, the way they do for every other game.
