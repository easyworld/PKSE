     * every later one down a place, so matching by position would find a different item at each of

     * removing the fourth medicine moved a used-up Max Potion from slot 59 to slot 16. Where a
     * pouch holds the same id more than once, the nth entry takes the nth recorded slot, which
     * reproduces an untouched pouch exactly as position matching did.
