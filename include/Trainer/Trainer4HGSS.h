/**
 * THE CONTAINER IS THE HARD PART OF GEN 4, and it is unlike anything else in PKSE.
 *
 * A Gen 4 save is 0x80000 bytes: TWO 0x40000 partitions, and the game alternates between them.
 * Inside each partition sit two independently-checksummed blocks -- General (trainer, party, bag,
 * flags) and Storage (18 boxes, names, wallpapers). The two are chosen INDEPENDENTLY: it is
 * entirely normal for the newest General block to be in partition 0 while the newest Storage block
 * is in partition 1.
 *
 * Selection compares a pair of counters in each block's footer, 0x14 from the block's end:
 *
 *     blockEnd - 0x14   u32  major counter     <- compared first
 *     blockEnd - 0x10   u32  minor counter     <- tiebreak
 *     blockEnd - 0x0C   u32  block size        == the block's own length (this is what identifies
 *                                                 DP from Pt from HGSS, since the sizes differ)
 *     blockEnd - 0x08   u32  SDK magic         0x20060623, or 0x20070903 for Korean
 *     blockEnd - 0x02   u16  CRC16-CCITT over [start, blockEnd - FooterSize)
 *
 * TWO CONSTANTS, TWO QUESTIONS. The counters are always 0x14 from the end; FooterSize is how much
 * of the tail the CRC EXCLUDES and is 0x14 for DP/Pt but 0x10 for HGSS. Unifying them corrupts
 * every HeartGold save.
 *
 * 0xFFFFFFFF IS "NEVER WRITTEN", NOT "NEWEST". A fresh save has one partition untouched, and its
 * counter reads larger than any real one -- a naive `a > b` picks the uninitialised garbage and
 * loads an empty save from a real file. compareCounters() reproduces PKHeX's handling exactly.
 *
 * SAVING writes back into the block that was LOADED (whichever partition that was) and refreshes
 * that block's CRC, plus a backup block's CRC only if that backup is initialised. It does NOT flip
 * partitions or bump counters -- PKHeX does not either, and not doing so is what keeps an unedited
 * save byte-identical, which is the bar a save editor has to clear.
 *
 * ONE container per SAVE-FORMAT GROUP, the way every Switch title has its own. PK4 is one record
 * format across all three Gen 4 groups, but the SAVES differ -- block sizes, box layout, bag base --
 * and the group is what the rest of PKSE dispatches on, so each group carries its own container and
 * its own record class.
