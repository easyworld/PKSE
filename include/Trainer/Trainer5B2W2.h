/**
 * Trainer5B2W2.h - the Black 2 and White 2 save container.
 *
 * AFTER GEN 4 THIS IS A RELIEF. No partitions, no counters, no "which half is newer". A Gen 5
 * save is a flat list of fixed blocks (BlockEntryNDSs.h, generated from PKHeX), each carrying a
 * CRC16-CCITT over its own data. Round-tripping an unedited save is therefore trivially exact --
 * there is nothing to choose and nothing to bump.
 *
 * The one rule that bites: EVERY BLOCK'S CRC IS STORED TWICE. Once just past the block's data,
 * once in the trailing checksum block. Writing only one leaves the save looking corrupt to the
 * game. And the checksum block CHECKSUMS ITSELF, so it must be stamped last, after every mirror
 * has landed inside it.
 *
 * ONE container per SAVE-FORMAT GROUP, the way every Switch title has its own. Black/White and
 * Black 2/White 2 differ in the block table and the main size (0x24000 vs 0x26000); the block
 * INDICES the save layer reaches for are the same in both, so what a group's container carries is
 * its own table. The file itself is 0x80000 either way; everything past the main size is slack.
 *
 * Two layout notes that are easy to get wrong:
 *
 *  - A BOX BLOCK IS 0xFF0 LONG BUT THE STRIDE IS 0x1000. The 16 bytes of slack at the end of each
 *    box are OUTSIDE the CRC, so corrupting them fails no checksum -- it just shows up as a
 *    round-trip diff. Never write past a box's 30 records.
 *  - THE BOX-NAME STRIDE IS 0x28 BUT ONLY 0x14 IS THE NAME. The other 20 bytes belong to
 *    something else; slice 0x14 and leave the rest alone.
