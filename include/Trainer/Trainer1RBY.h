/**
 * The first save PKSE opens that does NOT come from a Switch title. There is no title id, no
 * backup directory and no `main` file -- it is a loose 0x8000-byte dump from an emulator or a
 * cartridge reader, picked with the file browser. Offsets are PKHeX's SAV1.cs + SAV1Offsets.cs.
 *
 * LOCALE CHANGES THE LAYOUT, NOT JUST THE TEXT. A Japanese save is not an international one with
 * different characters in it: the name fields are 6 bytes instead of 11, there are 8 boxes of 30
 * instead of 12 of 20, and every offset from the trainer block onward shifts. Nothing here may
 * assume international. The locale is not recorded anywhere in the file either -- it is inferred
 * from which offsets hold a well-formed Pokemon list, which is what `detect()` does.
 *
 * Four things about this format have no counterpart in any later generation:
 *
 *  1. THE CHECKSUM IS ONE BYTE. `~(sum of 0x2598 .. checksumOfs-1)`, stored at checksumOfs. It
 *     covers the trainer block and everything after it, so a party edit changes it.
 *  2. THE CURRENT BOX IS STORED TWICE. Boxes live in two banks (0x4000 and 0x6000), but whichever
 *     box the player last had open is ALSO mirrored at `currentBox`, and that copy is the fresh
 *     one -- the game writes there as you play and only flushes to the bank on a box change. Read
 *     the wrong copy and the player's most recent box reads as stale. Both must be written back.
 *  3. A BOX RECORD IS 33 BYTES, A PARTY RECORD 44. The missing 11 are level + the five battle
 *     stats, which the game recomputes when a Pokemon leaves the PC. Box mons are therefore grown
 *     to party size and their stats recalculated on load -- the same thing the game does, and the
 *     reason `Pokemon1RBY` always holds a party-size body.
 *  4. THERE ARE NO BOX NAMES. The games have none; PKHeX synthesises "BOX 1".. for display. So
 *     `supportsBoxNames()` is false and PKSE shows its own defaults.
 *
 * Money is 3-byte big-endian BCD, capped at 999999 -- not a plain integer. Items are Gen 1's own
 * id space with its own names (see `Pokemon::getItemNameGen1`); the modern table names every slot
 * of a Gen 1 bag wrongly.
