/**
 * The shape is Gen 1's -- a flat SRAM image with no encryption, boxes split across two banks, a
 * summed checksum -- but almost every constant differs, and four of the differences are traps if
 * you carry a Gen 1 habit across:
 *
 *  - THE CHECKSUM IS 16-BIT AND NOT INVERTED. Gen 1's is one byte and `~sum`; Gen 2's is a
 *    wrapping u16 sum over [Trainer1, AccumulatedChecksumEnd] INCLUSIVE, stored twice, and stored
 *    LITTLE endian even though every entity field in the format is big endian.
 *  - THE CURRENT-BOX MIRROR IS THE STALE COPY, the opposite of Gen 1. PKHeX's own comment: "Don't
 *    treat the CurrentBox segment as valid; Stadium ignores it and will de-synchronize it." So
 *    read the BANK, write the BANK, and refresh the mirror afterwards as a courtesy.
 *  - THE BOX STRIDE IS THE LIST LENGTH PLUS 2. Boxes sit every `SIZE_BOX_LIST + 2` bytes, and the
 *    split between the two banks is after box 7 (6 in Japanese), not Gen 1's.
 *  - MONEY IS A 3-BYTE BIG-ENDIAN FIELD read as a u32 shifted right by 8, so the fourth byte
 *    belongs to something else and must be preserved.
 *
 * There is no version byte and no magic number: `detect()` probes two Pokemon-list headers per
 * candidate layout, exactly as PKHeX does, and the ORDER matters -- Japanese GS and Japanese
 * Crystal share one of their two probe offsets and are separated only by the other.
 *
 * SCOPE: International and Japanese. Korean GS is deliberately not claimed -- it needs the
 * double-width StringConverter2KOR table and a second, differently-shaped checksum, and it is the
 * one locale with no test save available. detect() returns false for it rather than mis-parsing a
 * file it half-recognises.
