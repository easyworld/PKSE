/**
 * PKSM (the 3DS save manager) keeps a cross-game bank of its own. This reads one and hands back
 * PKSE-native entities ready to drop into Trainer::Bank. PKSE stays AGPL-3.0 with no mixed-
 * license bookkeeping; crediting PKSM is a courtesy, not an obligation.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THAT WILL BITE YOU: PKSM stores each Pokemon **decrypted**, because that is how it
 * holds one in memory and the bank is a verbatim dump of that buffer. PKSE's bank stores NATIVE
 * (encrypted) bytes, and every ::Pokemon entity's constructor decrypts what it is handed. So the
 * import path has to ENCRYPT on the way in -- and for Gen 3 that means re-shuffling the four
 * substructures into their PID-keyed order as well, because PKSM undoes that too. A plain memcpy
 * across produces a bank full of Pokemon that look almost right and are quietly corrupt.
 *
 * The second trap is the generation tag: it is NOT the generation number. Gens 1-3 were added to
 * PKSM late and got appended to the end of its enum, so Gen 3 is 6 and tag 3 is Gen 7 (PKSMGen).
 *
 * Deliberately filesystem-free: scan() takes the file's bytes, so the parser compiles and can be
 * tested on an ordinary desktop compiler exactly like the rest of the save layer.
