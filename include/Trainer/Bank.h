/**
 * A HOME-style storage bank: boxes of Pokemon that live OUTSIDE any single save file,
 * persisted to the SD card under sdmc:/PKSE/bank. UNIFIED across all games: every slot
 * carries its own game-group tag + native (encrypted) per-generation bytes, so Pokemon from all
 * six titles coexist in one bank. Deposit is passive (store as-is, byte-in == byte-out) --
 * the bank never converts or mutates a stored pokemon. Only withdraw-INTO-a-save converts, and
 * that cross-generation conversion is the caller's job (see TrainerViewScreen), not the bank's.
