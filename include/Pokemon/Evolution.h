/**
 * Evolution.h - Performing a trade evolution on a record PKSE is holding.
 *
 * A TRADE EVOLUTION IS A LOCAL RECORD MUTATION. The trade is only the trigger: the receiving game
 * runs its ordinary evolution check when the Pokemon arrives, the check passes because a trade is
 * what happened, and the record is rewritten in place. Nothing in the save records that a trade
 * took place, no second party appears in the data, and there is nothing to reconcile afterwards --
 * so no second save file is needed to produce the same bytes the games would have produced.
 *
 * What the games change, and what this does:
 *   SPECIES + FORM   the destination pair. A form of "keep what it had" is already resolved in the
 *                    table, so Alolan Graveler becomes Alolan Golem and a Small Pumpkaboo becomes a
 *                    Small Gourgeist.
 *   ABILITY          the same SLOT, re-read for the new species -- a hidden-ability Pokemon stays
 *                    hidden. Identical to what the species picker does (applySpeciesChange).
 *   HELD ITEM        CONSUMED when the Pokemon is holding the one the evolution asks for. The
 *                    games destroy it; it does not return to the bag. Not holding it is not a
 *                    refusal -- see TradeEvolutionOffer.
 *   NICKNAME         follows the species, but ONLY when it was the species name to begin with.
 *   STATS            recalculated from the new base stats.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH. **EXP and level stay exactly as they are.** The games do not
 * award or reset experience on evolution, and every one of the twenty-six trade-evolution pairs
 * shares a growth rate with its pre-evolution, so the stored EXP still means the same level
 * afterwards. That is the one place this must NOT reuse applySpeciesChange, which re-derives EXP
 * from the level because an arbitrary species swap can cross growth rates -- doing that here would
 * silently discard progress toward the next level. Friendship is not touched either: a TRADE
 * changes friendship, an evolution does not.
 *
 * FROM GENERATION 6 ON A TRADE LEAVES A TRACE, AND THIS IS NOT WHAT WRITES IT. Such a record carries
 * a handling trainer, and PKHeX reads an empty one as "never traded" (EvolutionMethod.ValidNotLevelUp
 * rejects a trade evolution on an untraded Pokemon). Stamping that handler belongs to
 * `Pokemon/Trade.h`, and the two run in that order -- the round trip first, then this -- because the
 * new handler's friendship is seeded from the species, which at that moment is still the
 * PRE-evolution. Gens 1-5 have no such field, so there the evolution is the whole of it.
