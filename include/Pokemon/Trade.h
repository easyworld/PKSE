/**
 * Trade.h - Writing the handler block as a real trade would.
 *
 * WHAT A TRADE RECORDS. Before Generation 6 a trade writes NOTHING to the record: there is no
 * handler field, the receiving game simply runs its evolution check on arrival. From Gen 6 on the
 * record carries a handling trainer, and that block is the only evidence a trade ever happened.
 *
 * WHY A ROUND TRIP. `applyTradeRoundTrip` emulates source -> partner -> source, which is what a
 * player does to trade-evolve a Pokemon and keep it. The two halves are not symmetrical: the
 * outbound trade writes the whole handler block, and the return leg writes exactly one thing --
 * `CurrentHandler = 0`. **THE HANDLER BLOCK IS NOT CLEARED ON THE WAY BACK** (PKHeX's TradeOT does
 * nothing else), and that residue is the point: the Pokemon is home with its original trainer while
 * still carrying the other player's name. That is the state every legitimately trade-evolved
 * Pokemon is in, and the state `EvolutionMethod.ValidNotLevelUp` looks for when it decides whether
 * a trade evolution was possible.
 *
 * THERE ARE THREE BEHAVIOURS, NOT ONE. PKHeX implements them as three separate overrides and so
 * does this: see TradeEra in the implementation. Generation 6/7 writes a link-trade memory and a
 * geolocation history; Let's Go has neither and copies friendship rather than resetting it; Gen 8
 * and 9 store a handler language and leave the memory to the game.
