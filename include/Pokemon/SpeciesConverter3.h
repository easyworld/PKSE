/**
 * SpeciesConverter3.h - Gen 3 internal <-> National Dex species index conversion.
 *
 * FireRed/LeafGreen do NOT store the National Dex number in an entity's species field
 * (u16 @ 0x20). National 1-251 are aligned, internal 252-276 are unused slots, and the
 * Hoenn species (National 252-386) live at internal 277-411 in the games' OWN order --
 * which is scrambled, not sorted. Exactly the same problem Gen 9 has from #917 on; see
 * SpeciesConverter9.h, which this mirrors.
 *
 * PKHeX reference (source of truth):
 *   - PK3.cs: `Species => SpeciesConverter.GetNational3(SpeciesInternal)`
 *   - PKHeX.Core/PKM/Util/Conversion/SpeciesConverter.cs:
 *       FirstUnalignedNational3 = 252; FirstUnalignedInternal3 = 277;
 *       Table3NationalToInternal / Table3InternalToNational
 *
 * This replaced a hand-derived "+25 for everything past 251" shortcut. The shift is real for
 * 26 of the 135 Hoenn species and wrong for the other **109**, which is why it survived a
 * spot-check: Tentacool, Unown and Granbull are all below 252 and were never affected, while a
 * created Trapinch was stored as Plusle, Flygon as Mawile and Deoxys as Chimecho. Nothing
 * errored -- the id was valid, just a different Pokemon.
 *
 * Both tables are delta tables: result = input + table[input - first]. Do not hand-edit the
 * deltas; they are copied verbatim from PKHeX.
 *
 * One DELIBERATE difference from PKHeX: a National id past 386 returns **0** (not obtainable in
 * Gen 3) where PKHeX returns the input unchanged. Callers rely on 0 as the "no Gen 3 equivalent"
 * signal -- the bank uses it to refuse a transfer as NotInDex.
