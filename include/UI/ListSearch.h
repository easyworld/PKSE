/**
 * WHICH LISTS HAVE ONE IS A RULE, not "all of them": a DIALOG that asks the user to pick an element
 * out of a list or array gets a search box. That is every picker kind, the Items pouch and the file
 * browser, plus Box/Bank in its highlight-rather-than-filter form. The two screens that pick WHAT TO
 * OPEN -- the save/title picker and the Save Backups screen -- deliberately do NOT: they choose a
 * target rather than an element, over lists short enough to fit on screen whole. Both once had a
 * box and both had it removed. Adding one to a list outside the rule is a product decision, never a
 * consistency tidy-up.
 *
 * The Met Location list is why the component exists at all: 600+ entries with no way to reach the
 * one you want. Sharing it rather than writing one per list is what stops a user who learns the
 * picker's search from having to learn the file browser's -- same key, same matching rule, same box
 * on screen, across the set.
 *
 * HOW A QUERY MATCHES. Case-insensitively, and EVERY whitespace-separated term must appear
 * somewhere in the label -- order-independent, so "couple nursery" finds "Nursery Couple". Someone
 * who half-remembers a name should not have to remember its word order too. Substring rather than
 * prefix for the same reason: "ball" finds "Poke Ball", which a prefix match would not.
 *
 * MATCH WHAT IS ON SCREEN. A list must filter on the label it actually draws, not on the value
 * behind it. Those differ constantly here -- the Met Location picker draws a name resolved through
 * the pokemon's origin version, the Form picker through its species -- and filtering on anything else
 * hides rows the user can plainly see.
 *
 * CLEARING. Accepting an empty query clears the filter. That is the whole contract, so no list
 * needs a second key for it, and there is no state a user can get stuck in.
