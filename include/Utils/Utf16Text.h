/**
 * From Black/White on, the games store text as plain little-endian UTF-16 in a fixed-width field,
 * so there is no character table -- but there are still two per-generation details, and both are
 * silent when wrong:
 *
 *  1. THE TERMINATOR DIFFERS. Gen 5 writes 0xFFFF (PKHeX StringConverter5.Terminator) and stops
 *     reading on either 0xFFFF or 0. Gen 6 and 7 write 0. Writing a 0 terminator into a Gen 5
 *     field leaves the field's tail as zeros where the game wrote 0xFFFF -- a round-trip diff on
 *     a save nobody edited.
 *  2. THE GENDER SIGNS ARE PRIVATE-USE. Gen 5 stores them half-width, U+246D and U+246E, and
 *     PKHeX normalises them to U+2642/U+2640 on the way in and back on the way out. A Nidoran♀
 *     read without that conversion shows a circled-number glyph. Gen 6/7 store the real ones.
 *
 * Field policy is the caller's: how many units the field holds, and whether the tail past the
 * terminator is cleared, are decided by whoever owns the offset.
