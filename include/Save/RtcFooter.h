/**
 * Gold, Silver and Crystal (and Gen 3) have a real-time clock, and emulators, flashcarts and
 * dumpers append its state after the save proper. The save itself is unchanged; the file is just
 * longer. Every size check in the loose-save probe chain is EXACT (0x8000, 0x10000, 0x20000), so
 * such a file matched nothing at all and PKSE reported "not a save PKSE can open" for a perfectly
 * good Silver save, everywhere the probe chain runs.
 *
 * The rule is PKHeX's `SaveHandlerFooterRTC` verbatim, tolerances included: the footer is the low
 * six bits of the length, it must be either 7 bytes (one flashcart writes an odd one) or an even
 * 0x0C..0x30, and what remains must be a size a Game Boy or GBA save actually is. Guessing more
 * loosely than that would start truncating files that are merely corrupt, which is worse than
 * refusing them -- a truncated save still parses, and then quietly holds the wrong data.
 *
 * Lives in its own header so the rule has ONE home and can be exercised without the Switch SDK:
 * GetSaveFileContents.cpp reaches it through <switch.h>, an off-console build does not.
